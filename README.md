Random Art Generator, as the name suggests, renders random graphics. The engine randomly generates 20 x and y coordinates. The coordinates then plot in an HTML Canvas and are connected using linear strokes. The probability of the generated art is so low that it is equivalent to 0, meaning that the art, once rendered, will not regenerate.

No Setups Required.
